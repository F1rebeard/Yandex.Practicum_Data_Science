# Yandex.Practicum_Data_Science
## Certificate : 
This repository is mainly for projects I have done under Yandex.Practicum_Data_Science.

Yandex.Practicum_Data_Science online programm helps me to achive new skill and knowledge and prepare me for a career as a data scientist. It helps to learn how to preprocess, organize and clean data, uncover pattern, insights and anomalies, visualize and repsresent the meaningful conclusions, make statistical research on the data, to learn different machine models and neural networks depending on the task and type of given data.

Tips: for data science project with python, I would recommend to install pandas, numpy, scipy, scikit learn, matplotlib, seaborn, tensorflow. These are the most basic libraries.

### Project 7 - Predict a location for an oil well
  In the region characterisits of different oil wells have been collected (oil quality and oil volume for each well). Depending on this data oil volume and quality is predicted for new wells. It is more efficienty to use a ML to predict then to test each oil well manually. After prediction the region with the maximum total profit is selected according to the oil wells predicted by model.
### Project 8 - Predict recovery factor of gold from gold ore.
  When the mined ore undergoes primary processing, a crushed mixture is obtained. It is sent to flotation (beneficiation) and two-stage purification. After this technological process the recovery factor of gold must be predicted.
