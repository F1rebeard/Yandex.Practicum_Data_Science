# Yandex.Practicum_Data_Science
## Certificate : 
This repository is mainly for projects I have done under Yandex.Practicum_Data_Science.

Yandex.Practicum_Data_Science online programm helps me to achive new skill and knowledge and prepare me for a career as a data scientist. It helps to learn how to preprocess, organize and clean data, uncover pattern, insights and anomalies, visualize and repsresent the meaningful conclusions, make statistical research on the data, to learn different machine models and neural networks depending on the task and type of given data.

Tips: for data science project with python, I would recommend to install pandas, numpy, scipy, scikit learn, matplotlib, seaborn, tensorflow. These are the most basic libraries.

## Part 0 - Intro to Data Science
Subjets covered:
  - 
### Project
## Part 1 - Data Preprocessing
Subjects covered:
  - different methods of dealing with gaps and anomaly values (artifacts);
  - changing the data type;
  - different methods of determining and dealing with duplicates;
  - data categorization.
### Project 1 - Research on the reliability of borrowers
  Bank credit department want to analyze how family status, number of kids and other factors. Given data - statitics abour bank clients paying capacity.

## Part 2 - Data Analyze
Subjets covered:
  - data visualisation(plots, histogramms, boxplots, subplots and etc.);
